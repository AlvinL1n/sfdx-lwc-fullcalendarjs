# Full Calendar JS - Lightning Web Components
- A simple implementation of Full Calendar JS (https://fullcalendar.io) in Lightning Web Components.

## Dev, Build and Test
- The calendar data is currently mocked but can easily be refactored to retrieve data from an Apex controller.

## Resources
- JQuery
- Moment.js
- FullCalendarJS

## Description of Files and Directories
1. `lwc/fullCalendarJs` - FullCalendarJS Lightning Web Component
2. `staticresources/FullCalendarJS` - JS and CSS files.

## Issues
- I'm not sure if LWC has a way to use `loadStyle()` with the `print` attribute similar to `<link>` tags. This is used to indicate that a separate CSS can be loaded for print or print preview.
